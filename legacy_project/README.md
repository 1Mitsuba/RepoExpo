# Legacy project backup

This folder contains files moved from the repository root to avoid duplication with the `expo-app` subproject.

Files moved here:

- `src/` - previous source files
- `scripts/` - sound generator script
- `index.js` - legacy entry that referenced `src/App.js`
- `KOTLIN.md` - Kotlin notes
- `README.md` - original README for the legacy copy

If you need to restore any file into the main workspace, move it back from this folder.
